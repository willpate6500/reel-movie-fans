            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">1 · Origins and Silent Era</h2>
            <p>
              Film history begins in the late 19th century when inventors across Europe and the United
              States attempted to capture motion through still photographs. The Lumière brothers
              introduced the cinématographe in 1895, enabling both recording and projection for public
              audiences, while Thomas Edison promoted the kinetoscope, an early peep-show viewer.
              Rapid experimentation yielded a new grammar for storytelling: Georges Méliès blended stage
              magic with stop-motion tricks in works like <em>Le Voyage dans la Lune</em> (1902), and D. W.
              Griffith refined cross-cutting and close-ups to build emotional intensity. As nickelodeons
              and movie palaces flourished, Hollywood emerged as an industrial powerhouse, drawing
              talent westward for its sunlight, varied landscapes, and studio backlots.
            </p>
            <p>
              The silent era produced global stars such as Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Mary
              Pickford, and fostered international movements. German Expressionism, exemplified by
              <em>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</em> (1920), conveyed psychological turmoil through distorted
              sets and chiaroscuro lighting. Soviet Montage theorists like Sergei Eisenstein argued that
              editing could manufacture meaning beyond individual shots, a principle he demonstrated in
              <em>Battleship Potemkin</em> (1925). Meanwhile, Japan and India cultivated their own cinematic
              languages, laying the groundwork for regional industries that still thrive today.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">2 · Sound, Studio Systems, and Global Waves</h2>
            <p>
              The arrival of synchronized sound in the late 1920s—famously heralded by <em>The Jazz
              Singer</em> (1927)—transformed cinema. Studios invested in new technologies, actors retrained
              for the microphone, and audiences marveled at musical numbers and snappy dialogue. By the
              1930s and 1940s, the classical Hollywood studio system reached full strength, producing
              genre staples like screwball comedies, film noir, and Technicolor epics. Vertical
              integration let companies control production, distribution, and exhibition until the U.S.
              Supreme Court's 1948 Paramount decision began dismantling that model.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond Hollywood, global cinemas offered vibrant alternatives. Italian Neorealism emerged
              after World War II with directors such as Roberto Rossellini and Vittorio De Sica, who
              shot on war-torn streets using non-professional actors to capture everyday resilience. The
              1950s and 1960s ushered in the French New Wave, whose critics-turned-filmmakers—François
              Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Agnès Varda—rejected polished conventions in favor of
              jump-cuts, handheld cameras, and self-reflexive narratives. Parallel movements blossomed
              in Brazil's Cinema Novo, India's Parallel Cinema, and Eastern Europe's New Wave, each
              merging local concerns with experimental form.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">3 · Blockbusters, Independents, and the Digital Turn</h2>
            <p>
              Post-1970 cinema saw the blockbuster era take shape as studios chased high-concept hits
              like <em>Jaws</em> (1975) and <em>Star Wars</em> (1977). Advances in visual effects, sound design, and
              merchandising strategies turned films into cross-media franchises. Simultaneously, a new
              generation of directors—Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas—combined art-house
              sensibilities with commercial scale, while independent filmmakers such as Spike Lee,
              David Lynch, and the Coen brothers carved space for idiosyncratic voices.
            </p>
            <p>
              The late 20th and early 21st centuries introduced digital cinematography, computer-generated
              imagery, and streaming platforms, reshaping both production and distribution. Documentaries
              gained fresh immediacy, world cinema reached broader audiences through festivals and online
              services, and new technologies like virtual reality hinted at immersive storytelling
              possibilities. Today, the history of film remains an unfinished narrative shaped by evolving
              tools, diverse creators, and audiences eager for stories that reflect—and challenge—their
              worlds.
